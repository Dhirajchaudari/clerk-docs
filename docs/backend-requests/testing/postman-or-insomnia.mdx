# Testing with Postman and Insomnia

Basic testing with Postman and Insomnia is very similar. This will get you started with either option.

## Generate Long Lived JWT Template

The standard token issued by Clerk expires after 60 seconds. The SDKs handle refreshing the token regularly so the auth state is up to date. When testing with Postman or Insomnia, this token isn't very useful as it will expire quickly.

You will want to create a long lived [JWT Template](/docs/backend-requests/making/jwt-templates), which we can place into Postman/Insomnia and not have to constantly update. To do that, go to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/), select the Application and the instance we want to test from the header. After that, select the left Nav item called [JWT Templates](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=/jwt-templates). 

Give your template a unique name, such as '*postman-template*'. Set the 'Token Lifetime' to a value that suits your needs, or use the maximum of 315360000 seconds or 10 years. If your normal token has Claims, then you can add the same Claims to your JWT Template.

## Fetch Long Lived Token

Visit your Frontend that is using the same Clerk Application and instance you want to test and login as a user. The user you log in as will be the user you test with in Postman or Insomnia. You can create several tokens for several different users. Once you have logged into, open your Dev Tools (usually F12) and go to the console tab. Enter the following command:

```
await window.Clerk.session.getToken()
```

## Using Postman or Insomnia

Open Postman/Insomnia and create a new request. Configure the correct method and route. In the Authorization tab, select Bearer Token. Paste the token you copied from the console as the Bearer Token. Your request will now authenticate as the user you created the token with.

## Variables

You can create a Collection in Postman or Insomnia, and inside of that Collection add Variables (Postman) or Environment Variable (Insomnia). These let you use the same token in multiple requests, and easily store tokens for multiple users. This is great for testing different features in your application by changing the token/user you are testing with. You can read more about Variables for [Postman here](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/) and for [Insomnia here](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/environment-variables).
